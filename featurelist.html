<h3>User-based stuff</h3>
- Theme thing, I've explained this already.<br />
- Custom rank colors, explained already.<br />
- Join IP notifications, IPs get sent to the host whenever someone joins<br />
- Command stuff, invalid commands inform the player that they're invalid and don't go to message (Yeah, yeah, I know I haven't put all the commands into this yet, but I will at some point.)<br />
- News requester, typing /news on a server with this mod will now request & display the news.<br />
- Overall play time recorder, typing /overallplaytime on any server while having this mod will give you your average overall play time (since getting the mod).<br />
- Fixed /me not going to IRC properly.<br />
- Mod weapon spawning restrictions. Mods can't spawn overpowered weapons using iGob anymore.<br />
- Fixed clearing teams saying the wrong name.<br />
- A nice Themi main menu button with colored stripes that represent your chosen rank colors.<br />
<i>- 0.3 -</i><br />
- Fixed /me going to #tbmservers
- Picture Display Gui

<h3>Developer-based stuff</h3>
- getIDfromIP(%ip) function, returns anyone on the server who has that IP. Returns 0 if nobody on the server has that IP.
