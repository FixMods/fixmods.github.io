The Theme GUI looks like this:<br />

The GUI consists of three sections.<br />
<br />
The first section is the Rank Color section.<br />
<img src="http://fixmods.github.io/theme%20gui%20ranks.png" /><br />
Here you can choose the colors of each rank. This color will appear in PMs, normal chat(provided your set theme has standard colors) and anywhere else where a colored name appears. Note that this part is removed if your set theme either does not have standard colors. This also gets removed if the person speaking has a formatted name.<br />
<br />
The second section is the Name Formatting section.<br />
<img src="http://fixmods.github.io/theme%20gui%20names.png" /><br /> 
This is where you can type in names that you want custom-colored, or if you want to change/add/remove stuff from someone's name.<br />
The bit on the left is the normal name and the bit on the right is the formatted name. (Note that formatted names use #c0 instead of /c0 or \c0, because of the way formatting works.<br />
<br />
The third and final section is the Theme Selection section.<br />
<img src="http://fixmods.github.io/theme%20gui%20themes.png" /><br />
This is where you can select a theme you wish to use. The name of the theme is on the left, and where the theme is stored is on the right. Themes are stored in dtb/client/Dynamic/FixFire/themes. To select a theme, <b>double click</b> on it. Refer to the help section below to learn how to make a theme.<br />
